Welcome to the Psychologist's data toolbox 2.0. This website contains educational materials on using [__R__](https://www.r-project.org/) and [__RStudio__](https://www.rstudio.com/) for effective data wrangling and visualization. In addition to introductory materials, there are tutorials for Psychology-specific data-analytic scenarios. Get started by clicking on the menu items above.

For first-time R users, I recommend reading the sections of this website in order (from left to right in the above navigation bar.) First, you should read the [introduction](introduction.html), and then [get to know the tools](rrstudio.html). When you are familiar with the RStudio environment, common steps in the data-analytic workflow are covered in their typical order. If you already know how to import data, for example, skip that section and move right on to the next topics.

* [Introduction](introduction.html)
    * What is toolbox 2.0 and why do we need it?
* [R and RStudio](rrstudio.html)
    * Learn the basics of R and RStudio
        - No programming experience required
        - 100% success or money back guarantee
* [Importing data to R](import.html)
    * How to get data files to R
* [Data wrangling](questionnaire.html)
    * Get started with data wrangling using real questionnaire data
* [Data visualization](plotting.html)
    * Create common data visualizations in R

Following data visualization, you would typically move to modelling the data, but this topic is outside the scope of these tutorials. I recommend reading a good textbook [e.g. @kruschke_doing_2014; @maindonald_data_2010; @mcelreath_statistical_2016].
