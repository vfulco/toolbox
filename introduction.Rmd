Many introductory statistics and research methods courses in psychology teach a particular workflow for moving from raw data to figures and statistical tests. This workflow heavily depends on two commercial tools: Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS. Students of these courses are instructed to perform basic data manipulation tasks, such as renaming variables, aggregating ("pivot tables") and subsetting data, etc., in Excel before proceeding to creating figures (in Excel or SPSS) and performing statistical inference (usually in SPSS.)

Based on my experience, this workflow is also common among researchers. Although skilled analysts can and do perfrom brilliantly when constrained by this basic recipe, better alternatives have, unsurprisingly, sprung up in the past two decades. I propose that by abandoning this Excel -> SPSS workflow (repeated _ad nauseam_ with slight tweaks that require many a buttons to be repeatedly clicked), students and researchers gain a better understanding of their data, and become better equipped to rapidly investigate their data from multiple angles. Specifically, the approach I recommend is based on _programming your analysis_. For statistical programming, we will focus on the R programming language. (For an in-depth analysis of how R has overtaken SPSS on almost any metric, see [this post](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/).)

Data is often messy and needs all sorts of transforms before it can be formally analyzed. Because this initial "data wrangling" usually needs to be repeated multiple times, the task can be greatly sped up by eschewing the use of Excel in favor of a programming language, where changing a few variables or arguments does what requires a completely new walk-through of the data in Excel. Similarly, because figures need to be repeatedly generated, creating them using code greatly reduces the required time for this step of a data-analytic workflow.

# Before we get started...

Programming is hard. You learn it by doing it. I recommend you follow the examples here by typing them into your own R script files, and execute them on your own computer. No prior knowledge of R or programming in general is required. Prepare to be frustrated. It is a natural part of learning programming.

# This tutorial

This tutorial consists of modules, where R is put to its proper use in wrangling different types of data. Users who wish to execute the code as they follow along should download [this zip file](https://github.com/mvuorre/toolbox/archive/gh-pages.zip) and place its contents somewhere on their hard disk. This archive contains all the materials required to reproduce every exercise and command presented on these pages, and can also be used to prepare a custome version of these pages. After downloading the zip file, extract its contents in an appropriate location on your hard drive, say your Documents folder. The unzipped folder is called `toolbox-gh-pages`, but you should rename it to `toolbox` (my apologies, this is a GitHub quirk.) Assuming you've extracted the folder from the zip file into your Documents folder, you now have the following file structure on your computer, under the Documents folder:

```bash

|-- common
    |-- Files for formatting this website
|
|-- data
    |-- various folders containing data files used in the tutorials
|
|-- images
    |-- various pictures used on these web pages
|
|-- [...].Rmd These files contain the source code for each tutorial
|
|-- [...].html The website you are browsing

```

Each `.Rmd` file contains blocks of R code that you can execute on your own computer. Every line of code within these tutorials will be in those files, so you can execute the code while reading the tutorials.
